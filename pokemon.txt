this is a textfile used for testing github add, push, commit and branch development

your pokemon of choice is: garchomp

it's type is ground/dragon.

this garchomp has a adamant nature. so it's atk is higher than average but it's sp.atk is lower.

this garchomp is holding a soft sand. so it's ground-type moves will hit harder.
